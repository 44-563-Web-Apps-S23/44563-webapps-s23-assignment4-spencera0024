        <h1>It is one act, but there is more</h1>
            <h4 class="mrsx">MRS. X.</h4> <p class="speech">And then he comes home and has to hunt for his slippers--Mary
has pushed them under the bureau. Well, perhaps it is not right to be
making fun of one's own husband. He's pretty good for all that--a real
dear little hubby, that's what he is. You should have such a
husband--what are you laughing at? Can't you tell? Then, you see, I know
he is faithful. Yes, I know, for he has told me himself--what in the
world makes you giggle like that? That nasty Betty tried to get him away
from me while I was on the road. Can you think of anything more
infamous?</p> <p class="direction">[_Pause._]</p> <p class="speech">But I'd have scratched the eyes out of her face,
that's what I'd have done, if I had been at home when she tried it.</p>
<p class="direction">[_Pause._]</p> <p class="speech">I'm glad Bob told me all about it, so I didn't have to hear
it first from somebody else.</p> <p class="direction">[_Pause._]</p> <p class="speech">And, just think of it, Betty was
not the only one! I don't know why it is, but all women seem to be crazy
after my husband. It must be because they imagine his government
position gives him something to say about the engagements. Perhaps
you've tried it yourself--you may have set your traps for him, too? Yes,
I don't trust you very far--but I know he never cared for you--and then
I have been thinking you rather had a grudge against him.</p>

     <p class="direction">[_Pause. They look at each other in an embarrassed manner._]</p>

<h4 class="mrsx">MRS. X.</h4> <p class="speech">Amelia, spend the evening with us, won't you? Just to show that
you are not angry--not with me, at least. I cannot tell exactly why, but
it seems so awfully unpleasant to have you--you--for an enemy. Perhaps
because I got in your way that time</p> <p class="direction">[_rallentando_]</p> <p class="speech">or--I don't
know--really, I don't know at all----</p>

     <p class="direction">[_Pause._ MISS Y. _gazes searchingly at_ MRS. X.]</p>

<h4 class="mrsx">MRS. X.</h4> <p class="direction">[_Thoughtfully._]</p> <p class="speech">It was so peculiar, the way our
acquaintance--why, I was afraid of you when I first met you; so afraid
that I did not dare to let you out of sight. It didn't matter where I
tried to go--I always found myself near you. I didn't have the courage
to be your enemy--and so I became your friend. But there was always
something discordant in the air when you called at our home, for I saw
that my husband didn't like you--and it annoyed me--just as it does when
a dress won't fit. I've tried my very best to make him appear friendly
to you at least, but I couldn't move him--not until you were engaged.
Then you two became such fast friends that it almost looked as if you
had not dared to show your real feelings before, when it was not
safe--and later--let me see, now! I didn't get jealous--strange, was it
not? And I remember the baptism--you were acting as godmother, and I
made him kiss you--and he did, but both of you looked terribly
embarrassed--that is, I didn't think of it then--or afterwards, even--I
never thought of it--till--_now_!</p> <p class="direction">[_Rises impulsively._]</p> <p class="speech">Why don't you
say something? You have not uttered a single word all this time. You've
just let me go on talking. You've been sitting there staring at me only,
and your eyes have drawn out of me all these thoughts which were lying
in me like silk in a cocoon--thoughts--bad thoughts maybe--let me think.
Why did you break your engagement? Why have you never called on us
afterward? Why don't you want to be with us to-night?
